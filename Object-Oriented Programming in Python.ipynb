You'll start by creating methods that set attributes, and then add a few methods that manipulate them.\n\nAs mentioned in the first video, an object-oriented approach is most useful when your code involves complex interactions of many objects. In real production code, classes can have dozens of attributes and methods with complicated logic, but the underlying structure is the same as with the most simple class.\n\nYour classes in this course will only have a few attributes and short methods, but the organizational principles behind the them will be directly translatable to more complicated code.","metadata":{},"id":"52b56ad7-3afc-4aa5-9540-f45bf185f38c","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"class Employee:\n  \n  def set_name(self, new_name):\n    self.name = new_name\n  \n  # Add set_salary() method\n  def set_salary(self, new_salary):\n     self.salary = new_salary\n  \n  \n# Create an object emp of class Employee  \nemp = Employee()\n\n# Use set_name to set the name of emp to 'Korel Rossi'\nemp.set_name('Korel Rossi')\n\n# Set the salary of emp to 50000\nemp.set_salary(50000)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","id":"9f1ffa64-d1af-47e9-a55e-e8abd4bcd362","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"## Using attributes in class definition\nIn the previous exercise, you defined an Employee class with two attributes and two methods setting those attributes.
